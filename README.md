# Clicky-Game using React


#Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events


Important

Be sure to utilize the MYSQL Heroku Deployment Guide in order to deploy your assignment.


# Instructions

There are 11 character images and the object of the game is to test your memory. You are only allowed to click each image (or character) once and must click all 11 to win. If you click the same image twice, you will get an alert letting you know you didn't win and will restart the game. 

After you click on each image, it will automatically shuffle the order of images and continue to do so until game is either won or lost. 

There is a counter to let you know how many images you have clicked correctly and a score counter to let you know how many total games you have won.
